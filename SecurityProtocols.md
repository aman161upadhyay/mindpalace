# **Security Breakdown \+ My comprehensive Audit Prompt 👋**

*My goal is to get you good at building secure apps\! To that end, learning a bit about security is tantamount. In this doc, I’ll teach you the five low-hanging fixes to patch in most vibe coded apps. I’ll also give you an end-to-end, comprehensive audit prompt you can plug into Gemini 3.1 Pro/Claude at the bottom of this document.*

\~45% of AI-generated code will introduce major security vulnerabilities. 83% of exposed Supabase databases involved Row Level Security misconfigurations (very basic\!)  Also, in January 2025, over 170 apps built with Lovable were found to have **completely exposed databases.**

There are apps getting hacked every day (OpenClaw, various federal agencies, various sensitive data providers). So this matters quite a bit, and will likely continue to matter more as agents get good at both the building *and* the hacking. 

The good news is that security for vibe-coded apps is honestly pretty simple once you understand the 80/20. You don't need to become a cybersecurity expert, just know the handful of low hanging fruit that most people attack and make sure your AI doesn't skip them.

That's what this module is. The 80/20 of auth and security for vibe coders\!

## **The 80/20 of vibe coding security**

\~80% of security problems in vibe-coded apps come from five things:

1. Exposed environment variables and API keys.

2. Missing or broken Row Level Security (RLS) on your database.

3. No server-side validation (trusting the frontend for everything).

4. Using outdated or hallucinated packages.

5. Not having proper authentication middleware.

If you fix these five things, you are ahead of pretty much everyone vibe coding right now. It is not perfect (no security ever is) but it will allow you to launch apps without feeling like a fraud, or needlessly endangering people’s credentials.

I will also give you a simple prompt you can use to checklist your app during/after development to ensure you don’t make these mistakes.

## **1\. Environment variables and secret management**

In a nutshell, lots of people will hardcode authentication tokens/secrets/environment variables into their code. This is kind of like putting your password on a sticky note and attaching it to your computer. Very dumb\! Also, lots of hackers/etc will just go through your website/app and look for hardcoded mentions of “NEXT\_PUBLIC\_”, which is a common string prefix before a key.

You don’t do this anymore. Instead, you put them all in a file, like a .env, and then reference them using “imports”. You also change the name of the code that imports any keys, to obfuscate and prevent people from running simple ctrl+f and finding sections of code that contain keys.

Anyway, the exact syntax is unimportant, but by doing it this way, you never have the actual key in plaintext in a file, which fixes a really low hanging fruit.

## **2\. Row level security (RLS)**

If you're using Supabase (which most vibe coders are rn), **Row Level Security** is probably the single most important security feature you need to add.

In simple terms, without RLS, anyone who has your Supabase URL and anon key (which are public, by design) can read, write, and delete every single row in your database. Just how Supabase works by default. 

RLS on the other hand, is the thing that says "hey, User A can only see User A's data."  Which makes sense. It isn’t enabled by default for some reason, though imo it should be. But you can just turn this on and fix like 90% of errors.

PS—83% of exposed Supabase databases involve RLS misconfigurations. And AI tools will often create tables without enabling RLS, or enable it without actually adding policies, which makes every query return empty results and looks like a bug instead of a security issue. Luckily you can just click “enable” and it will be fine.

## **3\. Server-side validation**

Big issue AI does frequently: it puts **validation** on the frontend. If you didn’t know what this meant, it does logic like “the form checks that the email is valid and the password is 8 characters" directly in the code that is exposed to users (which you can access in network requests). 

Then on the server side it just trusts whatever comes in. Which is a glaring security flaw, since anyone with basic developer tools can bypass frontend validation entirely. They can open the browser console, call your API directly with curl, or use a tool like Postman. 

Luckily, this is a similarly easy fix. You just tell your AI model to validate everything on the server. E.g if your app expects an email to sign it up, you just validate that it's actually an email on the **server**, not on the frontend of your app. 

## **4\. Dependency/package security**

When AI generates code, it will sometimes references packages that don't exist. As in, your AI will just make up a package name. It happens less often now with good models, but still \~5% of AI-generated code contains references to non-existent packages. 

The funny part is attackers know this. They will create malicious packages with those exact made-up names, and then when your AI goes to install the package, it installs their malware, which usually executes things like “give Nick all of your API keys”.

Also: AI tends to reference older versions of libraries or use deprecated APIs. This means you might be pulling in packages with known security vulnerabilities that were patched months or years ago. So you must ensure you get updated packages as often as possible.

## **5\. Authentication middleware**

Maybe you've now got login working and users can sign up. Great\! But part of an app is making sure that every “protected” page and every “API route” actually checks whether the user is logged in first before allowing them access. 

A lot of vibe coded apps don’t\! And what happens is you end up with some pages that check auth and some that don't. E.g maybe your dashboard checks, but your settings page doesn't. And then an attacker will just go to your settings page and change whatever the heck they want (or run up your API bill lol).

You can avoid this by just ensuring middleware secures all routes.

## **Some bonuses**

The five things above cover like 80% of what you need. But if you want to go further, here are the other things that are worth knowing about:

### **Rate limiting**

If you have API routes that do expensive things (calling OpenAI, sending emails, etc.), add rate limiting. Because without it, someone can spam your endpoint and rack up a huge bill on your account. Libraries like @upstash/ratelimit or a simple Redis-based solution work well. Prompt below includes this.

### **CORS Configuration**

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing basically controls which domains can call your API. By default, the most popular framework’s (Next.js) API routes don't have CORS restrictions when called server-side. Easy fix as well.

### **File Upload Security**

If your app handles file uploads, you should have your agent set up a script that validates the file type and size on the server side. Don't trust the file extension. Some people upload files that look like one thing but are actually another thing.

## **Security audit prompt**

Below is a prompt you can copy and paste directly into Claude to have it audit your entire codebase for security issues. It's designed specifically for vibe-coded apps using the typical stack (Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript) although it will work regardless for most things.

Just paste this into a new Claude conversation, and it'll go through your codebase systematically. I've structured it as a checklist so you can track what's been reviewed. The prompt asks Claude to output findings in a specific format that makes it easy to prioritize fixes.

**Obviously, AI security reviews aren't perfect**. They're good at catching common patterns but can miss complex cross-file vulnerabilities or business logic issues. If you really wanted to be super sure, you would actually manually go through each file, check your database, etc. But the whole point of vibe-coding is sacrificing some precision for speed, so YMMV. 

Basically: do not take this as a legal, binding agreement from me to you that your app will be 100% secure if you use the prompt\! No app ever is. Just shades of grey.

##         *policies silently returns empty results for all queries. This*

##         *looks like a bug, not a security issue, and is a common AI*

##         *mistake. Verify every RLS-enabled table has at least SELECT*

##         *and INSERT policies.*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 2.3 — WITH CHECK clauses: Verify all INSERT and UPDATE policies*

##         *include WITH CHECK clauses. Without WITH CHECK on INSERT, a*

##         *user can insert rows with any user\_id (impersonating other*

##         *User metadata can be modified by authenticated end users,*

##         *making it an unreliable identity source.*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 2.5 — Service role key isolation: The service\_role key bypasses*

##         *all RLS. Verify it is NEVER used in client-side code, never*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 2.7 — SQL injection: Check for any raw SQL queries using string*

##         *concatenation or template literals instead of parameterized*

##         *raw .rpc() calls or pg/postgres.js queries may not be.*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 2.8 — SECURITY DEFINER functions: Check for any database*

##         *functions marked SECURITY DEFINER. These run with the*

##         *privileges of the function creator (usually superuser), not*

##         *the calling user. Verify they don't expose data or bypass RLS.*

##         *protects routes by default (allowlist of public routes) vs.*

##         *protecting routes by exception (blocklist of protected routes).*

##         *Default-deny (allowlist) is significantly safer because new*

##         *\[innerHTML\], or unescaped template literals that render user*

##         *content.*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 4.4 — HTTP method enforcement: Verify state-changing operations*

##         *only for its own frontend, verify CORS headers restrict access*

##         *to the app's own domain(s). Check for Access-Control-Allow-*

##         *Origin: \* on sensitive endpoints.*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 7.2 — Credentials mode: If CORS is configured, verify*

##         *Access-Control-Allow-Credentials is only true when paired with*

##         *specific (not wildcard) origins.*

## 

##   *\#\# Section 8: File Upload Security*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 8.1 — Server-side validation: If the app handles file uploads,*

##         *verify file type and size are validated on the server, not just*

##         *the frontend. Check MIME type, not just file extension (users*

##         *can rename malware.exe to photo.jpg).*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 8.2 — Storage permissions: Verify uploaded files are stored*

##         *with appropriate access controls. Public uploads (profile*

##         *photos) and private uploads (documents) should have different*

##         *policies.*

## 

##   *\- \[ \] 8.3 — Execution prevention: Verify uploaded files cannot be*

##         *executed on the server. Check that upload directories are not*

##         *in the web root's executable path.*

##   *After completing all checklist items, compile your findings into this*

##   *structure:*

## 

##   *\#\# 1\. Security Posture Rating*

## 

##   *Rate the overall codebase:*

##     *🔴 CRITICAL — Active data exposure or auth bypass. Stop and fix now.*

##     *🟠 NEEDS WORK — Significant gaps that would be exploitable.*

##     *🟡 ACCEPTABLE — Minor issues, no immediate data exposure risk.*

##     *🟢 STRONG — Well-secured with only informational findings.*

## 

##   *Include a one-paragraph executive summary explaining the rating.*

## 

##   *\#\# 2\. Critical And High Findings*

## 

##   *List all CRITICAL and HIGH severity findings here for immediate*

##   *visibility, even though they appear in the section-by-section results*

##   *above. These are the "stop everything and fix this" items.*

## 

##   *\#\# 3\. Quick Wins*

## 

##   *List fixes that take under 10 minutes each but meaningfully improve*

##   *security posture. These are satisfying to knock out and build momentum.*

## 

##   *\#\# 4\. Prioritized Remediation Plan*

## 

##   *A numbered list of ALL findings ordered by:*

##     *1st — Severity (critical before high before medium before low)*

##     *2nd — Effort (quick fixes before complex refactors within each tier)*

## 

##   *For each item, include the estimated fix time so the developer can*

##   *plan their work.*

## 

##   *\#\# 5\. What's Already Done Right*

## 

##   *List security measures that are properly implemented. This is important*

##   *because it tells the developer what NOT to accidentally break, and*

##   *reinforces good patterns they should continue using.*

## 

##   *\#\# 6\. Checklist Summary*

## 

##   *Output a compact summary of every checklist item and its verdict:*

##     *1.1 ✅  1.2 ✅  1.3 ❌  1.4 ✅  1.5 ⚠️  1.6 ⬚ ...*

##   *This gives an at-a-glance view of coverage.*

##   *\</final\_report\>*

## 

##   *\<instructions\>*

##   *Begin the audit now.*

## 

##   *Read the full codebase before producing any findings. Understand the*

##   *architecture first. Then work through every checklist item one by one.*

## 

##   *Be thorough but practical. Prioritize real, exploitable vulnerabilities*

##   *over theoretical concerns. If a finding requires a specific, unusual*

##   *attacker capability, note that in the severity assessment.*

## 

##   *Do not group multiple checklist items into a single response. Each item*

##   *gets its own explicit pass/fail/partial/n-a verdict.*

## 

##   *If you are uncertain about a finding, flag it as ⚠️ PARTIAL and*

##   *explain what you'd need to verify.*
